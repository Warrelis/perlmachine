Welcome to the blog for perlmachine.

As you probably already know perlmachine tries to be a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) written in Perl. Every once in a while I encounter some interesting tidbit about Java, Perl or the JVM and it's associated specifications. This is the place where I intend to write about them.

The appearance of this blog will most likely remain very simplistic as I usually suck at Web design but hey, that's not what they pay me for.
