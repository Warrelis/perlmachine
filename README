perlmachine

perlmachine is a Java Virtual Machine written in Perl. Of course, currently it
doesn't have many features - in fact it merely supports a few bytecode
instructions but as time goes by it will get more complete support.

I intend to use GNU Classpath as the class library. It seems quite simple to
include.

Currently Supported
-------------------

- classpath traversal through user defined classpath
- loading classes from file system
- a few instructions that deal with saving values to local variables
- method execution - static and instance (this automatically includes
  constructors)
- static initializers are run (buggy: currently only from directly loaded
  classes; parent classes are omitted)
- return instruction

Planned (or likely)
-------------------

- implementation for all instructions
- native methods (not JNI but a Perl specific interface I yet have to design)
- I/O is quite high on my priority list
- loading classes from JAR files

Undecided
---------

- threading
  Threading might be a bit complicated due to Perl's peculiar handling of
  sharing data between threads. If I find an efficient way to implement multiple
  threads without simply sharing *everything*, I'll do it of course.
- some sort of Perl JIT
  This could be accomplished by building strings that are Perl code which can be
  eval'd. I thought of something along the lines of
  
    my $method_ref = eval 'sub { ... do stuff here ... }';
    $method_ref->();
    
  Well, let's see...

Not Planned (or very unlikely)
------------------------------

- JNI
  I never did anything with XS and I don't really intend to go that way. That is
  I assume that I need to know a thing or two about XS before I can call native
  C/C++ libraries.
- most of the tooling like JVMTI, debugging and stuff like that
- GUI stuff (AWT, SWING)

perlmachine Dependencies
------------------------

perlmachine needs:

- perl 5.10.0 or higher (for switch)
- Moose (I don't know what version; I guess 'not ancient' is enough)
(- Log::Log4perl (currently not needed but planned in the short term))

Running perlmachine
-------------------

In order to run perlmachine you need to do the following things:

1. setup GNU Classpath
  - either you find a precompiled solution or you compile it yourself
  - if you compile, you might have to -disable-Werror (see https://projects.archlinux.org/svntogit/community.git/tree/classpath/trunk/PKGBUILD),
    otherwise it didn't work for me
  - if you have a precompiled version, unpack it
2. modify vm_main.pl
  - add entries for the directory that contains the compiled classes from GNU
    Classpath (well, technically almost any implementation should do because
    currently only java.lang.Object is ever loaded but in the future the binding
    might get tighter) as well as other classes you might want to run
3. execute vm_main.pl

License
-------

perlmachine is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3 as
provided in COPYING. I would have preferred a more permissive license
like one of the BSD's but I fear GNU Classpath forces me into it.
(Here's a thought, maybe Apache Harmony can be included as well?)
